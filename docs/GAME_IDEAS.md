# Game ideas — backlog

Captured from playtest feedback. Not built yet — parked here so they're not lost.

## 1. GeoPaint (colour-match)

A colour-matching game. The player is shown a country and a target flag layout
with one region highlighted (e.g. "Put **Sweden** here" with the yellow cross
shown). They start from a random colour on the wheel and use three sliders —
**Hue, Saturation, Lightness (HSL)** — to match a given region of the flag to
its real-world colour as closely as possible.

- Score = how close the chosen colour is to the official flag colour (ΔE / HSL
  distance), per region, averaged.
- Could reuse the official hex values we already store in `buildFlagPuzzles.ts`
  piece colours, or pull from a per-flag palette table.
- Open question: single-region rounds first (easier), then multi-region flags.

## 2. Flaggle-style outline reveal (distinct from existing Flagle)

Inspired by "Flaggle Online" (verify we're not copying their assets — clean-room
the mechanic, not the content). Mechanic: the player **types a country/flag
guess**; for each guess, only the **outline of the parts of that flag's design
that overlap the answer flag** is revealed, narrowing the answer down by
elimination.

- Note: we already ship a `flagle` screen (FlagleScreen.tsx) — this is a
  *different* mechanic (outline/overlap reveal), so it would be a new game id,
  not a replacement.
- Open question: how to compute "overlapping design parts" — likely a curated
  per-flag feature set (stripes/canton/disc/cross/star) rather than pixel diff.

## Notes / smaller follow-ups
- "Peoples & Cultures" fun-fact pool currently has **32** entries (only flags
  with a written `note` show). Expanding it means writing more cultural facts in
  `src/data/ethnicFlags.ts` — content task, flagged for a decision.
- Gauntlet: a few flags render slightly zoomed-in — reported as acceptable for now.
