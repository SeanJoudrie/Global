// The United Kingdom is the one Codex country that drills down into its
// constituent nations. Each nation carries its own flag history — the modern
// national flag plus the older kingdoms and royal banners tied to that land
// (Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, the Lion Rampant, Glyndŵr's banner…). Histories
// are ordered newest → oldest, matching the country flag-history convention.
//
// A note on honesty: the Anglo-Saxon "kingdom" banners (Wessex, Mercia,
// Northumbria) are *attributed* arms — early-medieval kingdoms had no flags in
// the modern sense. The notes say so rather than implying these flew at the time.
